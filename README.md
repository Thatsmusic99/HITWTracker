# HITWTracker
A companion mod that tracks and presents game results and data from MCC Island's game Hole in the Wall. It is not officially endorsed or approved by Noxcrew; it is purely a community-driven project.

## Features
- Tracking of each individual game played, including placement, walls survived, duration survived, and players tied with.
- Automatic determination of death cause.
- Breakdowns of stats made every day, e.g. the total number of wins, ties, walls survived, and walls per win.
- Breakdowns of stats made per map, including overall performance across all maps.
